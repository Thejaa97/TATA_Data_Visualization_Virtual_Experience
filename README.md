## TATA - Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

This is a virtual internship programme offered by Forage and in this internship, I employed as a consultant to review their Online Retail Store data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyze what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year. The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and I need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion. Mainly there are four tasks I need to go through to complete my task.

Task 1: Framing the Business Scenario

Task 2: Choosing the Right Visuals

Task 3: Creating Effective Visuals

Task 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis
